**What can that do for you ?**
Detects a lighting and can measure the temperature and humidity and sends all three data to your MQTT broker!

**What do you need ?**
- ESP32 (I use an fireBeetle)
- DHT22
- AS3935 lighting detector

**Who can you do that ?**

1. Connect the AS3935 and the DHT22 to the ESP like in the fritzing diagramm
2. Flash the sketch (change your credentials)
3. Have fun
